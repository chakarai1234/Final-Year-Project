## File: FYP_VGG15.ipynb

- ### This is the file created to run the program for Image dataset using keras (tensorflow backend) for the prediction (This files need GPU for Faster processing)

## File: Hog_standardScaled_SVC.ipynb

- ### This is the file create to run the program for Image dataset using Scikit Learn module for the prediction of Images

## File: load_neu.py

- ### This file is for preprocessing the images for the two files above
